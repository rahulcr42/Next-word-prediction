## Overview

The Next-word-prediction project uses a trained machine learning model to predict the next word in a sentence. It is designed to enhance the writing experience by providing word suggestions based on a partial input. The model is trained using a dataset of text and applies various NLP techniques to understand the context of the sentence and predict the most likely next word.
