# Next-word-prediction

This project implements a **Next-Word Prediction** model using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model predicts the next word in a sentence based on a given input sequence using machine learning algorithms, helping to enhance the writing experience by providing word suggestions based on partial input.

## Overview

The **Next-word-prediction** project uses a trained machine learning model to predict the next word in a sentence. This model is based on various NLP techniques that process and understand the context of the text. The purpose of this project is to provide word suggestions to users as they type, which can enhance their writing speed and accuracy.

This model has been trained on a dataset of text and uses algorithms to predict the most likely next word based on the input context. The project includes several components for training, testing, and serving the model via a web API using Flask.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for building the machine learning model and backend.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for training and testing the machine learning model.
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for serving the model predictions via an API.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques such as tokenization and context understanding to process and predict words.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Training and evaluating the model to predict the next word based on input text.
- **HTML**: Basic structure for creating a simple user interface (if applicable).
